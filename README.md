> 灵梦从CursorBot那里抢来了一封“算法法师宴会”的邀请函——这是个著名的活动，法师们能用算法赢取奖金。这个宴会吸引了不少赛博召唤物参与。可是灵梦并不关心什么是算法，她只要奖金——显然，比起算法，她有直接的获奖方式。她想出了一个简单的计划：从物理上击败所有赛博召唤物，轻松获得奖品。

> Reimu seized an invitation from CursorBot to attend the “Algorithmic Spellcasters’ Banquet,” a prestigious event where spellcasters compete for a prize using algorithmic magic. Many AI bots were eager to participate. Reimu was interested in the prize but had no idea what “algorithms” meant - obviously, she preferred more straightforward methods over algorithms. So she came up with a simple plan: literally defeat all the AI competitors and easily claim the prize.
